Paragraph: I try to reframe the conversation around the relatively simple reality:
Paragraph: Modern medicine does not have the tools to firmly diagnose and/or specifically treat the cause of their symptoms.
Paragraph: The best treatment option available is to try to mitigate symptoms in the least harmful way possible.
Paragraph: Non-pharmaceutical interventions are both a way of trying to improve symptoms and help address the psychiatric challenges many people with chronic illnesses face.
Paragraph: Once I was overly personal and shared that I get the nervous shits before important exams. I experience diarrhea, I’m not making up my diarrhea for attention but if I had a scope, GI panel, CT, etc, it would all be negative. It doesn’t mean my diarrhea isn’t distressing to me but it does mean that we treat it differently than other, more obvious causes. That patient no showed the next appointment though… does help me frame it in a way to maintain my own empathy (not that I think you’re lacking that).
Paragraph: lol I stress poo too 😂
Paragraph: IBS gang rise up! (And sit back down on the toilet again)
Paragraph: NAD - I have ulcerative colitis, and found most of the online support groups to be echo chambers. Folks tend to blame everything either on IBD or the meds we use to treat it. “I sneezed twice at 4:17pm on Tuesday last week and that never happens, but my doctor says it’s not a side effect of Inflectra. I have never sneezed on a Tuesday at 4:17pm before in my life, and certainly never while on Remicade! I must switch back! My doctor doesn’t believe me, they never believe me!”
Paragraph: I’m curious though - what is it about ME, Lyme, POTS, MCAS etc that sets them apart from other illnesses? Is it because they’re not as well researched yet, or because they involve diagnoses of exclusion, or because the pain or true impact on ADLs is harder to quantify?
Paragraph: We get these patients in the ED frequently.
Paragraph: “I have EDS and need dilaudid because I’m having a pain flare. It’s a super rare genetic disorder I doubt you’ve ever heard of it but that’s what I need.”
Paragraph: Funny how you’re the fifth patient I’ve seen this week with the same complaint. Damn must be a hell of a cluster of this rare condition where I live.
Paragraph: And you’re the fifth patient I’m not giving dilaudid to. Because the worst thing you can do for EDSers is get them hooked on opiates because that’s going to cause significant disability.
Paragraph: And when they argue I just don’t understand their SUPER RARE (usually self-made) diagnosis, I just casually dislocate my shoulders and explain I have EDS myself, diagnosed fifteen years ago, and teach about it.
Paragraph: There are so many zebras around there you must live in Africa. The insistence on being rare and special fascinates me. Actual rare disease are bad things to have.
Paragraph: Dislocating your shoulder to them is such a boss move.
Paragraph: “I believe your pain is real, but I am not trained or comfortable in prescribing “insert drug/treatment here” for “insert condition here.” I am, however, able to do “XYZ” to treat your pain.”
Paragraph: I don’t deal with pain patients, but this is what I tell patients who ask for certain treatments not recommended by any legitimate professional guidelines.
Paragraph: It puts off the immediate problem and might get rid of the patient, but “I’m not trained” is a dodge. “I am trained, and my expertise says that insert-treatment-here is unlikely to be helpful while XYZ is. You came to a doctor for expertise; that’s mine.” Some patients didn’t come for expertise, they came for a dispensary and they’re disappointed, but knowing better is literally the job of cognitive specialties.
Paragraph: When people use the term gaslight, i ask them what do they mean by that term, as I find it a bit vague.
Paragraph: The responses are interesting.
Paragraph: “Gaslighting” has become a word you use when you are losing an argument and want to change the subject
Paragraph: gaslighting = not agreeing w my "lived experience" and sparse online research of a v few niche articles w a small sample size, so telling me as someone w ME to go for a walk will literally kill me
Paragraph: The people that misuse this term make me insane. They don't even know it was from the movie.
Paragraph: CBT is a way of shaping people's automatic negative thoughts about everyday life.
Paragraph: I guess all CBT providers are just glorified gaslighters ?
Paragraph: 😂🤡😂🤡.
Paragraph: You joke but I have heard this argument made. "You're just invalidating my truth and telling me to think about it differently!!!" I guess..... yes. It's gonna work just trust me bro.
Paragraph: I have a few of these patients on my panel.
Paragraph: I put my foot down and tell them I'm not going to rx opioids because it's not going to help them, and in the long run it's going to make their pain worse. Sometimes that's the last I ever see of them. Aside from that, I validate their concerns because, whatever's going on with them, it's certainly affecting their life negatively.
Paragraph: I'll typically attempt to recommend very light activities like aquacise with a PT that sound kinda fun to them and they might be interested in. Generally I think if you try to get them feeling like you're on the same side and you're going to figure out their condition and what helps it together then they're more receptive to recommendations. I avoid talking about anything psych/somatoform.
Paragraph: Now, my whole hot take on this situation is that these online groups are a form of shared negative self-reinforcement. I spy on them sometimes (there's a big ME/CFS form called Phoenix Rising if you're interested.) It really seems like they collect medical conditions like they're Pokemon and then attribute every s/s to them.
Paragraph: You'll get posts like "I'm thirsty all the time, is that my fibro?" and then a bunch of posts chiming in about how they're also thirsty all the time and it's definitely the fibro.
Paragraph: It almost seems like a cycle of somatize symptom (or have unrelated symptom) -> attribute to condition -> integrate condition into view of self -> somatic symptom strengthens, repeat. It's a struggle because I want to help these people and I have no idea how.
Paragraph: I only see the pelvic pain side of this, and I am very used to discussing scopes for endo, etc.  But, my patients seem to understand that I'm not dispensing controlled substances on a regular basis, so they usually don't even ask.  I can't imagine being the primary pain person or PCP for some of these patients who refuse physical therapy, CBT, pain adjuncts, etc. It would be very difficult especially with the online echochambers reinforcing them.
Paragraph: I have seen a very high number of negative scopes for these types of patients that have the hEDS, IBS, fibro, etc etc etc.  They seem very... disappointed that they dont have a chronic and lifelong illness.
Paragraph: I don't know that I have advice, just sympathy.  If someone accused me of medical gaslighting, I would be kinda dumbfounded.
Paragraph: Edit: I think my only advice is that I speak from my experiences with anxiety.  Discuss the awesome power that our nervous system wields over our physical senses and how we process signals.  Calling it "just in your head" is very dismissive of how powerful our brains and peripheral nervous systems are in shaping how we feel physically and mentally.  I talk about allodynia with patients a lot.  How pressure or light touch can become pain due to a hijacking of an inappropriate peripheral nerve pathway or central sensitization.  I frame SSRIs and tricyclics for pain patients as "neuromodulators."  I explain that they can be used for anxiety and depression, but I use them to alter their nervous system response to peripheral signals that should not be painful.  Framing it for patients as a physical process of the neuro system (which it is) helps them to feel more validated and buy into some adjuncts, i think.  It also just helps explain their experience.
Paragraph: All that aside, some people want to wallow.  Some want to be miserable, and you won't change their minds.
